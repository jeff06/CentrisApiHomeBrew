# CentrisApiHomeBrew

This C# api poke centris to retrive a listing of property base on a json body.
The return is based on the html pages. It support multiple return pages.
Ive put in the Doc file exemple to retrive information.
I am currently working on an interface to generate the json payload.

I also made a Postman collection to help you.

If you would like to see a specific payload, you need to intercept the query.
Any help is welcome

Please do not overload the centris website with multiple request. Use common sense.
